# Modding Training

This mod is a bundle of things I created as a training for myself, to try to familiarize with the Quilt mod loader.

## Warning

Everything here is made for fun and learning, so some features might be broken!

Also, don't expect me updating this mod to all latest Minecraft versions nor providing support.

I only use the Quilt mod loader and I don't have to justify this choice.

## License

This mod is licensed under the MIT License, meaning you are free to update it (or its features) by your own means,
or even port it to a different mod loader if you want to!


You just need to make sure to credit me and any other person involved in the parts of code you use.
